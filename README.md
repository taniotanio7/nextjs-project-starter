This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## TODO List

When starting new project:
- [ ] Replace base colors in tailwind.config.js
- [ ] Generate favicons and put them into `src/_app.tsx`
